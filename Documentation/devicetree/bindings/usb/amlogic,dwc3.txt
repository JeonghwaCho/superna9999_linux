Amlogic Meson GX DWC3 USB SoC controller

Required properties:
- compatible:	depending on the SoC this should contain one of:
			* amlogic,meson-axg-dwc3
			* amlogic,meson-gxl-dwc3
- clocks:	a handle for the "USB general" clock
- clock-names:	must be "usb_general"
- resets:	a handle for the shared "USB OTG" reset line
- reset-names:	must be "usb_otg"

Required child node:
A child node must exist to represent the core DWC3 IP block. The name of
the node is not important. The content of the node is defined in dwc3.txt.

PHY documentation is provided in the following places:
- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/meson-gxl-usb2-phy.txt
- Documentation/devicetree/bindings/phy/meson-gxl-usb3-phy.txt

Example device nodes:
		usb0: usb@ff500000 {
			compatible = "amlogic,meson-axg-dwc3";
			#address-cells = <2>;
			#size-cells = <2>;
			ranges;

			clocks = <&clkc CLKID_USB>;
			clock-names = "usb_general";
			resets = <&reset RESET_USB_OTG>;
			reset-names = "usb_otg";

			dwc3: dwc3@ff500000 {
				compatible = "snps,dwc3";
				reg = <0x0 0xff500000 0x0 0x100000>;
				interrupts = <GIC_SPI 30 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
				dr_mode = "host";
				maximum-speed = "high-speed";
				snps,dis_u2_susphy_quirk;
				phys = <&usb3_phy>, <&usb2_phy0>;
				phy-names = "usb2-phy", "usb3-phy";

Amlogic Meson G12A DWC3 USB SoC Controller Glue

The Amlogic G12A embeds a DWC3 USB IP Core configured for USB2 and USB3
in host-only mode, and a DWC2 IP Core configured for USB2 peripheral mode
only.

A glue connects the DWC3 core to USB2 PHYs and optionnaly to an USB3 PHY.

One of the USB2 PHY can be re-routed in peripheral mode to a DWC2 USB IP.

The DWC3 Glue controls the PHY routing and power, an interrupt line is
connected to the Glue to serve as OTG ID change detection.

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-g12a-usb-ctrl"
- clocks:	a handle for the "USB" clock
- clock-names:	must be "usb"
- resets:	a handle for the shared "USB" reset line
- reset-names:	must be "usb"
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- interrupts:	the interrupt specifier for the OTG detection

Required child nodes:

USB Ports are described as child 'port' nodes grouped under a 'ports' node,
with #address-cells, #size-cells specified.

Each 'port' sub-node identifies a possible USB Port served by an USB PHY
identified by the 'phy' property as decribed in ../phy/phy-bindings.txt

Each 'port' is identified by a reg property to number the port.

The following table lists for each supported model the port number
corresponding to each PHY serving a physical USB Port.

 Family	   Port 0     Port 1    Port 2    Port 3    Port 4
---------------------------------------------------------------
 G12A	   USBHOST_A  USBOTG_B  Reserved  Reserved  USB3_0
